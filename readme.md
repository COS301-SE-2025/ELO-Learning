## 📄 Description

ELO Learning is an innovative educational app designed to make learning mathematics engaging and enjoyable. Rather than grouping students strictly by age, ELO Learning focuses on individual skill development, offering a personalized learning experience that adapts to each learner's unique abilities.

The platform encourages growth through competitive, skill-based challenges—such as ranked matches against peers—and a dynamic reward system that motivates progress. By breaking down traditional educational silos, ELO Learning empowers students to advance at their own pace and unlock their full potential.
